# Retrofix Cyan (ES-DE Theme)
This is a customised version of [anthonycaccese](https://github.com/anthonycaccese)'s ES-DE port of the Retrofix theme by [20GotoTen](https://github.com/20GotoTen). It's created mostly for my personal use, so I'll really only be making changes to the systems I personally use (though PRs for other systems are welcome).

## Changes Made

- WIP

## **Configuration Options**

- The theme has a simple set of options that can be changed directly from the UI Settings menu of ES-DE 
   - Options:
   - `Theme Aspect Ratio`- sets the aspect ratio the theme will render at. If needed, this should be changed to match the aspect ratio of your screen.
   - `Theme Variant`- sets the layout used for the gamelist view when media & metadata are scraped for your games
- 16:9 & 16:10 aspect ratios are supported
- there are 3 gamelist layouts to choose from (immersive, simple & carousel)
